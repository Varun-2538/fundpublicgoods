- add an "EmitLog" event that takes a worker_id & log string and appends it to the logs database
- subscribe to logs inside of the application and show them
- add a "StrategyComplete" event that takes a worker_id and a complete strategy and appends it to the database
- pull the strategy from the database when complete, and use its data instead of the mock data
