This is crucial in the DeFi space where low market cap entities often struggle with liquidity.\n\nFor Polygon, our solution means empowering more projects to easily launch their own microeconomy on its network. By leveraging the powerful combination of customized  [AragonOS](https://client.aragon.org/#/) and [ABCs](https://medium.com/commonsstack/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-b5ca4fad4436), we simplify the deployment process of these economic tools, making them more accessible and user-friendly. This increased accessibility can democratize the DeFi space, foster sustainable economic growth, and position Polygon zkEVM as a leader in redefining the future of DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDonations in this round will help us raise the capital needed to integrate Aragon CS tooling into Polygon zkEVM, providing the community with advanced governance features, a user-friendly interface, access to proven templates, integration with the wider Aragon ecosystem, and scalability benefits. These advantages contribute to a more robust, participatory, and cost-effective DAO experience on Polygon zkEVM, fostering community growth and enabling the project to thrive. We simply want to take the tools we build for the TEC and apply the lessons we learned so it is easy for other communities to launch their own ABC DAOs on Polygon zkEVM."
