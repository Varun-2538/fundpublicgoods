        "description": "### THE PROBLEM \n\nSetting up an Ethereum Node is technically demanding and needs a lot of research & preparation to do. Being confronted with this challenge, a lot of people therefore choose to use a staking service. A understandable choice: if they are in the position of owning 32 ETH, they do not want to risk their funds. But, in turn, this slowly centralizes the network. \n\n\n### OUR SOLUTION  \n\nOur answer to this problem is STEREUM, our Ethereum node installation, setup & management tool.  \n\nStereum is a toolkit to simplify the process of setting up and maintaining an Ethereum/Gnosis Node. It provides an intuitive GUI to ease the installation process down to a few clicks, lessening the technical entry barrier to a minimum. By reducing complexity, Stereum will therefore attract more individual stakers to the network, promoting Ethererum\u2019s principle of decentralization. \n\n\nTo use Stereum, you download the launcher and connect remotely to your fresh Ubuntu server. \n\nIn only three clicks Stereum will configure all necessary prerequisites your server has to meet, install and run Ethereum client software, and will ensure that your node is properly connected and synced with the network. \n\nBy setting up your own node with Stereum, you are able to participate in Solo Staking in your prefered network and validate transactions and blocks. Your node also serves as your gateway to the network for data science, dApp usage and development. \n\nAs Stereum aims to be the most flexible way to leverage your node for ETH staking, you also have the opportunity to run different node related protocols (like SSV, etc.) and profit of their unique architecture. \n\n\n### \ufeffUSE OF FUNDS  \n\n\ufeffYour contribution is greatly appreciated by the team and will be used in various ways \u2013 development, testing and security audits. We spend the funds generated through grants and donations purely on tasks that will benefit the progress of the project and therefore the decentralization of Ethereum as well as the protocols on it. \n\n### FURTHER LINKS\n\n- \ud83c\udf44\ufeff Project Website - https://stereum.net/\n- \ud83d\udd28\ufeff GitHub - https://github.com/stereum-dev/ethereum-node\n- \ud83d\udcac\ufeff Discord - https://discord.gg/DzAwgnSXtB\n- \ud83d\udcf0\ufeff Twitter - https://twitter.com/stereumdev\n- \ud83d\udcfa\ufeff YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/@Stereum",
