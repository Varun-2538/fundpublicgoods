        "description": "Introduction:\nWe are proposing the development of ethRPCtoREST, an open-source project that aims to create a REST wrapper around the JSON-RPC APIs of the execution layer of Ethereum nodes. This project will serve as a simplified interface for programmers to interact with the Ethereum network, making it more convenient and human-friendly.\n\nNecessity:\nThe current RPC interface of the execution layer is inconvenient for programmers. The responses returned by the nodes are hex-encoded, making them difficult to understand and work with. This creates a barrier for developers who want to build applications on top of Ethereum. By developing ethRPCtoREST, we can simplify the interaction process and make it more accessible for programmers.\n\nImpact:\nThe impact of this project will be significant. By providing a REST API interface, we can attract more developers to build on Ethereum and contribute to its ecosystem. This will lead to an increase in the number of applications and services available on the network, ultimately driving adoption and usage. Additionally, by simplifying the interaction process, we can lower the barrier for entry and encourage more developers to experiment with Ethereum.\n\nProgress:\nThe development of ethRPCtoREST started during the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship from July 10th, 2023, to October 29th, 2023. Since then, significant progress has been made. Around 17 REST endpoints have been developed, covering approximately 18 execution layer methods. These endpoints act as wrappers around multiple methods or consolidate multiple methods into a single endpoint for ease of use. Weekly development updates have been recorded and are available for transparency.\n\nEligibility:\nethRPCtoREST meets all relevant eligibility criteria for funding. It is an open-source project that aims to develop and advance the broader Ethereum ecosystem by providing a simplified interface for developers. The ongoing progress and meaningful GitHub activity within the past three months demonstrate our commitment to continuous development and improvement.\n\nBy supporting ethRPCtoREST, you will contribute to the growth and accessibility of the Ethereum network. Your donation will help us maintain and enhance the project, ensuring that developers have a user-friendly interface to interact with Ethereum's execution layer. Together, we can empower more developers to build innovative applications on Ethereum and drive the adoption of Web3 technologies.",

Some of them don't yet give a simplified response. Ideally we want all of the methods to have simplified requests and responses.\n\nGoal is that simplification should make with least knowledge of operations of Ethereum ecosystem can handle it through few requests.\nTransactions like deploying a contract, interacting with it, and accessing values of maps in storage should be simple and no knowledge prerequisite should be required. Currently through standard JSON-RPC APIs there is a whole set of operations you need to do, before creating a request.\n\nAlso, in far future we can see - the number of applications and services built on top of ethRPCtoREST. This shows how useful and impactful our project is for enabling developers to create innovative solutions on Ethereum."
