        "description": "### Since 2018, Dappnode has been a key software for blockchain infrastructure and a big part of decentralization in Ethereum.\nDappnode is a decentralized infrastructure platform that allows users to easily host their own decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain nodes. Dappnode makes it easy to host and run various types of blockchain software, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, IPFS, and others. The platform also provides users with a user-friendly interface to manage and monitor their nodes.\n\n![dappnode-dashboard](https://bafybeidnqnfyvbsyd3pxhpxxdhharclupqmkrdphyzvgc4mpqnhq2lvx5i.ipfs.w3s.link/dappnode-dashboard-gg.png)\n\nOne of the key benefits of using Dappnode is that it enables users to participate in decentralized networks without needing to rely on centralized infrastructure, such as cloud hosting providers. Users also don't require to have a high technical skillset, since the Dappnode UI makes it easy for users at all levels of technical experience to run their own nodes.\nSolo staking in Dappnode is made simple thanks to the Stakers Menu, which allows you to set up an Ethereum node ready to validate in a few clicks:\n\n![stakersmenu.png](https://bafybeibus3tmm7dtxrbtoo6m7knxrwrmkatiublxpcjxz2cbod4mnrxdiy.ipfs.w3s.link/ethereum-staking-screenshot-d41fdd2a5a44f0e9e7f4094c41ea9e2d.png)\n\nDappnode is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and improvement. The platform is also community-driven, with users collaborating to create and share tools and resources to enhance its functionality.\nDappnode recently launched its Rollups menu, catching up with the needs of its users for privacy as they adapt to scaling solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem. The first implementation was with Optimism, but we'll be expanding to other L2s in the following months. We specially look forward to adapting these new features to ways in which rollup sequencers can decentralize and offer incentives to participants. The Rollups Menu works just like the Stakers Menu:\n\n![rollupsmenu.png](https://bafybeibthhvryza6o6djtofed4ogwv6hqyjiugqanapggogse3fxdvuhz4.ipfs.w3s.link/optimism-menu-60612170996d4b9863d79b0a737bb280.png)\n\nSome other projects we worked on with the resources that the last round we participated in gave us are:\n\n**Staking Brain improvements**: Dappnode\u2019s UI for managing keystores in validators.\n**Ethical Metrics**: a built-in tool for Dappnode that allows node runners to receive e-mail notifications about the status of their Dappnode while preserving their privacy.",

It helps earn higher rewards on average by pooling MEV rewards among a group of Solo Stakers. It works by setting the Fee Recipient address to the Smooth Smart Contract, and the rewards that the Smart Contract receives are distributed among all those who are pooling their rewards.\n- **Rollups Menu**: a new addition to the Dappnode UI that allows users to run L2 nodes."

There is no token at the current moment nor plans to restore it in the near future. \n\nDappnode doesn't take a cut of any validators running on them and Dappnode users are completely self-sovereign, but at the same time Dappnode has tried to find many ways to financial sustainability, to continue supporting the thousands of users that use our software. On one side, some of them have bought the Dappnode Hardware, making a contribution with their payment to the team that also builds the software, but that unfortunately is not enough to maintain the project at the current rate of updates in the sector.\nOur intention is to become sustainable and not to rely on grants, and we believe we can find a non-extractive business model that will leverage web3 characteristics to create truly win-win-win situations.\n\nThanks for your help on pushing our team forward while we find new non-extractive business models that can give sustainability to the project!"
