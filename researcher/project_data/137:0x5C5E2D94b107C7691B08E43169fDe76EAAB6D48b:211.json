GALXE DEFY would be integrated in our manniet.\nWe are moving our whole app towards App chain and are looking to integrate with Polygon CDK for providing our users with fast, secure and intent resolver in standard resolver format.\nThis would be Polygon's first intent based protocol with its one and only LLM based intent solver and that would be a game-changer for the whole ecosystem.\n\n\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc16 \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc04 \ud835\udc14\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc04 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc12 \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc13?\nWe will be using the grant for following things to grow our ecosystem:\n\nDevelopment and Expansion of Intent-Based LLM: Our priority is integration with Polygon's biggest protocols and creating a data layer to host all the data coming and going out of blockchain in the ecosystem. To create a near-perfect intern, we will need all the data that degens are looking at irrespective of accessibility.\n\nTalent: Our team is right now very focused and has been running bootstrapped for the last 1 year, if we get the grants we will be recruiting the right minds to accelerate the ecosystem that we are building for Polygon.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Marketing: Part of the grant will be dedicated to marketing which includes co-marketing running campaigns and getting KOLs on-board.\n\nResearch and Development: We will invest in ongoing research and development of AI and Intents to stay ahead, ensuring that our product remains highly relevant, performant, and secure.\n\n\n\ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27?\nWe as a team have been a long time MATIC holders and Polygon supporter with lots of contribution in the ecosystem. Thus we believe in the purple future of Polygon.\n\nBranding: Porfo is moving from Pre-alpha phase to getting there first 1000 users, and focusing heavily on UX and UI, and start the distribution we need a very simple but highly innovative branding. Which takes a lot of research and development.\n\nUsing Polygon Reach: Once the grants are approved we would have one of the biggest ecosystem name backing us, helping us acquire users and getting more protocols on-board.\n\n\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a'\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude3f\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68: \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68.\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude64.\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude65\n\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6c \ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67: \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude68://\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67.\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude62/0\ud835\ude6d\ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude64\n\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a'\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a: \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude64.\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude65\n\nWe are thrilled about all that we are creating \ud83d\ude80, and with your backing, we can turn this project into reality, driving Polygon towards a more decentralized tomorrow \ud83c\udf10.
