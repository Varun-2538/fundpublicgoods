Accessing the dWeb can be a frustrating experience. For dApp developers, this leads to a limited selection of platforms and services in addition to lost revenue.\n\nThe LIMO project brings additional resiliency to dApps by providing an alternative means of access as a public good. As the decentralized web continues to grow, it is imperative that community projects facilitate the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.\n\nThe LIMO project is organized around the following founding principles:\n\n1. Operate ETH.LIMO as a public good.\n\n2. Establish community governance and oversight.\n\na. Provide support and technical guidance for builders and users.\n\n3. Work towards building a truly decentralized ENS/IPFS gateway service and global CDN.\n\n4. Build a world-class developer platform for dweb sites, including integrated analytics reporting and traffic management deployment tooling for commonly used web2 patterns such as A/B testing, canary and blue/green deployments.\n\n5. A commitment to open source software and the advancement of web3 through education, best practices, evangelism, and public accessibility.\n\n\n\n[Documentation](https://github.com/ethlimo/documentation)\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/zf8NxW94rB)\n ",

Quickly roll back or fail-over in the event of a bug or vulnerability.\n\n\ud83d\udd35Privacy friendly RPC services - Take advantage of eth.limo\u2019s privacy policy and deployment tooling for pure RPC requests.\n\n\ud83d\udd35Testnet support - Experiment with ENS domains on Ethereum test networks.\n\n\ud83d\udd35Improved SEO experience.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Solving the \u201cLIMO dilemma\u201d \u2014 providing integrity and verification checks for dweb content transiting public gateway services to ensure that malicious gateway operators are unable to MITM (man in the middle) user sessions.\n\n\ud83c\udf0e Decentralizing the LIMO infrastructure through a community run CDN.\n\nWhy do we need ETH.LIMO?\n\n\u2714\ufe0fCore internet infrastructure is becoming increasingly centralized and as such, several existential threats have emerged that undermine the principles of an decentralized, open and free internet:\n\n\u2714\ufe0fLack of non-commercial infrastructure\n\n\u2714\ufe0fOpacity of terms of service agreements and moderation policies\n\n\u2714\ufe0fProliferation of proprietary browser extensions which require centralized services \n\n\u2714\ufe0fThe erosion of the \u201ccommons\u201d and \u201cpublic space\u201d\n\n\u2714\ufe0fWeb 3.0 adoption is still nascent\n\n\u2714\ufe0fMost browsers cannot natively access ENS/IPFS\n\n\nFor end users, this means a limited selection of poor quality services that increasingly resemble a cable TV package. Accessing the dWeb can be a frustrating experience. For dApp developers, this leads to a limited selection of platforms and services in addition to lost revenue.\n\nThe LIMO project brings additional resiliency to dApps by providing an alternative means of access as a public good. As the decentralized web continues to grow, it is imperative that community projects facilitate the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.\n\nThe LIMO project is organized around the following founding principles:\n\n1. Operate ETH.LIMO as a public good.\n\n2. Establish community governance and oversight.\n\na. Provide support and technical guidance for builders and users.\n\n3. Work towards building a truly decentralized ENS/IPFS gateway service and global CDN.\n\n4. Build a world-class developer platform for dweb sites, including integrated analytics reporting and traffic management deployment tooling for commonly used web2 patterns such as A/B testing, canary and blue/green deployments.\n\n5. A commitment to open source software and the advancement of web3 through education, best practices, evangelism, and public accessibility.\n\n\n\n[Documentation](https://github.com/ethlimo/documentation)\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/zf8NxW94rB)\n ",
