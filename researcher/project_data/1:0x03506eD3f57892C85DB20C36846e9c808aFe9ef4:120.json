It **automatically turns the device into an ARM64 Full Ethereum node or a home Staking box**.\n\nOur main goal is to **lower the barriers of running an Ethereum L1 or L2 node** by automating complex processes, ultimately encouraging more users to participate in the network. This contributes directly to **network decentralization**.\n\nAdditionally, our work empowers developers by providing them with the tools necessary to run a development or testing node and end-users to use their nodes for their daily operations.\n\nThis is what we've been up to in the last months (thanks to your past contributions):\n\n- Develop **EOA-config**: A **console menu interface to easily run an L1 or L2 Full/Archive node in seconds** (currently in alpha).\n- Support and include more Ethereum clients (added **Reth**).
