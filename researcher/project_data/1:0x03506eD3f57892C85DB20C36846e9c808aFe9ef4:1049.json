It covers everything related to Layer 2, from its history and definition to its inner mechanisms and details of individual projects. Our main goal is to demystify the concept of Layer 2 and its associated technologies using learner-friendly language, making it the perfect starting point for your journey into the Layer 2 world. The platform caters to both newcomers to the Layer 2 space and experienced individuals looking to deepen and expand their knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, L2 Learn serves as a DID (decentralized identifier) platform. You can record your learning activities on-chain and earn certificates in the form of SBT, soulbound tokens. This design ensures that your learning achievements are permanently stored and can be verified on-chain, turning your wallet into a decentralized identifier.\n\n## Why L2 Learn?\nLayer 2 technology has significantly impacted the blockchain development landscape and plays a pivotal role in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, many individuals are hesitant to explore this space due to a lack of understanding, often caused by intimidating technical jargon and a scarcity of accessible resources. As a result, uncertainty prevails among the masses, hindering the broader adoption of this groundbreaking technology.\n\nTo address this issue and promote the extensive adoption of Ethereum, L2 Learn was developed. To achieve our mission, we are committed to:\n- Reducing the entry barrier to the Layer 2 space by providing completely free educational content accessible to everyone.\n- Serving as a gateway to the Layer 2 world by offering high-quality, reader-friendly content that simplifies complex concepts.\n- Becoming a comprehensive social hub for learning everything about Layer 2, offering in-depth lessons and resources in one place.\n\n## Impact\nAt this time, there is no learning hub dedicated to Layer 2, despite the fact that Layer 2 is the future of ecosystem and there is so much excitement about it. The only way for users to gain an understanding of Layer 2 is to read the docs, blog posts for each project and media overview. However, due to the knowledge gap between developers and users, there are few opportunities for users to learn about Layer 2 in a comprehensive manner. L2 Learn will provide third-party learning opportunities to raise the level of users' knowledge of Layer 2, and beyond that, to further deepen their understanding of Layer 2.\n\n## Project Plan\nL2 Learn will not only serve as a comprehensive learning hub about Layer 2, but will also run on Polygon as a valuable platform for issuing SBTs. We are now preparing for the launch of the mainnet. Specifically, here is what we are planning for:\n- Issuing thousands more SBT certificates on Polygon's testnet\n- Raise awareness of Polygon ecosystem by sharing the issued SBT certificates on social media with the tens of thousands of users already present\n- Integrate Polygon's mainnet so that SBT certificates can be issued\n- Create a Polygon-specific curriculum on L2 Learn\n\n## Team\nL2 Learn was founded by Tomo, an expert in crypto-blockchain learning platforms. Prior to launching L2 Learn, he ran and sold a Learn to Earn product called Proof of Learning (PoL) for 5 years. No one has a better track record in this area of learning platforms than him.\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/tomohiro_tagami"
