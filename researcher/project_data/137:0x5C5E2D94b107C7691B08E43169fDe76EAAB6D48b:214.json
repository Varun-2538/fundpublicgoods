We are eagerly looking forward to your contribution :)\n\n---\n\n## Background - Impact of the Grant\nThis funding drives two key initiatives to enhance the protocol and drive further value to the Polygon ecosystem:\n\n- **Integrating Polygon ID as a Quest Type**: We're incorporating Polygon ID as a quest type, aiming to make it a primary user authentication method as it gains traction. This move offers game studios better sybil resistance, allowing for higher-value rewards and more authentic engagement. It also increases privacy for end-users by minimizing the need to share various accounts for quest participation.\n\n- **Expanding to Immutable zkEVM**: We plan to launch on Immutable zkEVM, a gaming-centric blockchain supported by Polygon CDK. This blockchain is EVM-compatible and hosts over 150+ games, making it a leader in the Web3 gaming ecosystem.\n\nFunding levels dictate the projects' scope and timelines:\n\n- Under $10,000: We'll integrate Polygon ID and conduct a feasibility study for Immutable zkEVM.\n- $10,000 to $25,000: We aim to complete one project by June 2024.\n- Above $25,000: Our goal is to finish both projects by June 2024.\n\nProgress updates will be shared on the THX Network's Discord channel throughout the first half of 2024.\n\n---\n\n## Background - Solution:\n\n![Dashboard THX Network](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/jR4ZPrTmpoJn.png)\n\nOver a dozen of quest and rewards are currently available using the THX Network dashboard. \n\ud83d\udc49 Explore the [product GitBook for an up-to-date and full overview](https://docs.thx.network/) of the product \ud83d\udcd6\n\n---\n\n## Background - Benefits to the Polygon Ecosystem:\n\nTHX Network's deployment on Polygon is driving adoption and transactions, as the gaming industry represents a vast market with billions of potential users. In just a few short months, THX Network has attracted more than ten thousand engaged campaign participants. Currently, we are adding new games to the protocol every week. A typical game launch can expect thousands of quests to be completed in the first few days. \n\nKey benefits for users include:\n\n1. **Affordable Non-Custodial Wallet Solution**: Utilizing Safe CORE for smart contract wallets, combined with multi-party computation (MPC) and a gas cost relay setup, THX Network offers a cost-effective non-custodial wallet solution for gaming on Polygon, see [THX Network HTML Widget User Guide](https://docs.thx.network/user-guides/html-widget).\n\n2. **Customizable Quests SDK**: Reward specific user behaviors in games or apps through the SDK. A very flexible and powerful tool for quest and reward infrastructure on Polygon. More info:  [JS SDK - THX Network](https://docs.thx.network/developers/js-sdk).\n\n3.  **Innovative Fee Structure**: The protocol's fee system is based on Balancer pool tech and voted escrow tokenomics. Fees are distributed among players, token holders, and protocol developers, creating benefits for all stakeholders in the ecosystem, see:  [THX Network Governance Forum](https://gov.thx.network/t/staking-feedback/70/4).\n\n![Events for Developers, THX Network dashboard](https://i.ibb.co/MNGKP5r/Events-Screenshot-2024-01-04-at-09-28-42.png)\n\n---\n\n## Background - Problem Statement\n\n**Up to 30% of game dev revenues go to middleman**\nGame developers lose up to 30% of their revenue to third-party app stores and marketplaces for distributing games and in-game currencies. A survey of over 3,000 industry professionals found only 3% believe this fee is fair. Compounding the issue, ad revenues and in-game transaction earnings are falling, especially in browser-based and mobile games, due to new privacy laws restricting user tracking. This trend is putting indie creators and small studios under increased financial pressure.\n\nSource:  [Most game devs don't think Steam earns its 30% revenue cut | (PCGamer.com)](https://www.pcgamer.com/most-game-devs-dont-think-steam-earns-its-30-revenue-cut/)\n\n**Player acquisition critical but too costly**\nGrowing and retaining a player community, especially during the early stages like alpha and beta testing, is crucial. Keeping the cost per install (CPI) as low as possible in the early stages and below the average return per user (ARPU) in the later stages of your game's lifecycle is critical. Surprisingly, only 10% of developers on a major game marketplace have earned over $100,000 in gross revenue. Investing in growth campaigns, such as quests and rewards to draw players, incurs significant opportunity costs in the game development process.\n\nSource: [What can we learn from the 1,600 highest earning indie developers on Steam?

We are eagerly looking forward to your contribution :)\n\n---\n\n## Background - Impact of the Grant\nThis funding drives two key initiatives to enhance the protocol and drive further value to the Polygon ecosystem:\n\n- **Integrating Polygon ID as a Quest Type**: We're incorporating Polygon ID as a quest type, aiming to make it a primary user authentication method as it gains traction. This move offers game studios better sybil resistance, allowing for higher-value rewards and more authentic engagement. It also increases privacy for end-users by minimizing the need to share various accounts for quest participation.\n\n- **Expanding to Immutable zkEVM**: We plan to launch on Immutable zkEVM, a gaming-centric blockchain supported by Polygon CDK. This blockchain is EVM-compatible and hosts over 150+ games, making it a leader in the Web3 gaming ecosystem.\n\nFunding levels dictate the projects' scope and timelines:\n\n- Under $10,000: We'll integrate Polygon ID and conduct a feasibility study for Immutable zkEVM.\n- $10,000 to $25,000: We aim to complete one project by June 2024.\n- Above $25,000: Our goal is to finish both projects by June 2024.\n\nProgress updates will be shared on the THX Network's Discord channel throughout the first half of 2024.\n\n---\n\n## Background - Solution:\n\n![Dashboard THX Network](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/jR4ZPrTmpoJn.png)\n\nOver a dozen of quest and rewards are currently available using the THX Network dashboard. \n\ud83d\udc49 Explore the [product GitBook for an up-to-date and full overview](https://docs.thx.network/) of the product \ud83d\udcd6\n\n---\n\n## Background - Benefits to the Polygon Ecosystem:\n\nTHX Network's deployment on Polygon is driving adoption and transactions, as the gaming industry represents a vast market with billions of potential users. In just a few short months, THX Network has attracted more than ten thousand engaged campaign participants. Currently, we are adding new games to the protocol every week. A typical game launch can expect thousands of quests to be completed in the first few days. \n\nKey benefits for users include:\n\n1. **Affordable Non-Custodial Wallet Solution**: Utilizing Safe CORE for smart contract wallets, combined with multi-party computation (MPC) and a gas cost relay setup, THX Network offers a cost-effective non-custodial wallet solution for gaming on Polygon, see [THX Network HTML Widget User Guide](https://docs.thx.network/user-guides/html-widget).\n\n2. **Customizable Quests SDK**: Reward specific user behaviors in games or apps through the SDK. A very flexible and powerful tool for quest and reward infrastructure on Polygon. More info:  [JS SDK - THX Network](https://docs.thx.network/developers/js-sdk).\n\n3.  **Innovative Fee Structure**: The protocol's fee system is based on Balancer pool tech and voted escrow tokenomics. Fees are distributed among players, token holders, and protocol developers, creating benefits for all stakeholders in the ecosystem, see:  [THX Network Governance Forum](https://gov.thx.network/t/staking-feedback/70/4).\n\n![Events for Developers, THX Network dashboard](https://i.ibb.co/MNGKP5r/Events-Screenshot-2024-01-04-at-09-28-42.png)\n\n---\n\n## Background - Problem Statement\n\n**Up to 30% of game dev revenues go to middleman**\nGame developers lose up to 30% of their revenue to third-party app stores and marketplaces for distributing games and in-game currencies. A survey of over 3,000 industry professionals found only 3% believe this fee is fair. Compounding the issue, ad revenues and in-game transaction earnings are falling, especially in browser-based and mobile games, due to new privacy laws restricting user tracking. This trend is putting indie creators and small studios under increased financial pressure.\n\nSource:  [Most game devs don't think Steam earns its 30% revenue cut | (PCGamer.com)](https://www.pcgamer.com/most-game-devs-dont-think-steam-earns-its-30-revenue-cut/)\n\n**Player acquisition critical but too costly**\nGrowing and retaining a player community, especially during the early stages like alpha and beta testing, is crucial. Keeping the cost per install (CPI) as low as possible in the early stages and below the average return per user (ARPU) in the later stages of your game's lifecycle is critical. Surprisingly, only 10% of developers on a major game marketplace have earned over $100,000 in gross revenue. Investing in growth campaigns, such as quests and rewards to draw players, incurs significant opportunity costs in the game development process.\n\nSource: [What can we learn from the 1,600 highest earning indie developers on Steam?
