This will accelerate the transition from the monoculture of a single unit of account, to a permaculture of many different ways to measure contributions to the world.\n\nLet's give the tools communities need to bring that future closer to the present, one token at a time.\n\nAnd let's make sure people can deploy their community token on Polygon :-)"
