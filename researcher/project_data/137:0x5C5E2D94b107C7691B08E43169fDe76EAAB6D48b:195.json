FlipSuite a truly a powerhouse of a product, solving many problems in one well thought out bot. \n\n- We've also built numerous tools and SaaS products like a custom NFT sweeping contest application with built in wash trade detection, listing and sales bots and a sniper bot.\n\nAdditionally, we've designed a mini language called Fluff, that allows NFT enthusiasts to create custom bots directly on our dashboard.\n\nThis proposal aims to tackle a few items:\n- Reduce the burden of existing infrastructure costs\n- Move our account abstraction layer to smart wallets/erc-4337 \n- Develop a concept around an open API on-top of our web 3 payment layer for discord, allowing developers to build on it.\n\nWe also have many other developments in the pipeline, and since we're a lean team, grant funding of any kind directly contributes to all of them, like our in-discord MMO, which is currently in beta. \n\n### In closing\n\nYou may see that we're closed source, and as explained to the Polygon Village team, it's imperative that our code remains that way at our current stage of development, however, any official Polygon rep is welcome to contact us directly and we'd happily grant them access.\n\nFlipGuard has been providing value to Polygon for just under a year, and hopes to continue doing so with the support provided here. \n\nDocs: https://wiki.flipguard.xyz\nDashboard: https://dashboard.flipguard.xyz"
