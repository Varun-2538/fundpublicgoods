Instead, they tirelessly search, listen to, and negotiate deals. \nWe would be very happy to showcase the tech stack, the current version of our prototype desktop app, or the mock-ups we want to build. \n\nA grant of 8.000-12.000$ would be of tremendous help to launch the Dapp by the end of the first quarter of 2024. \n\nWe would use the grant to finance the development, Desktop Frontend development, and start with the UX and UI design for our mobile app.\n"
