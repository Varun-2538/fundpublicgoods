These includes: a python bundler, opens source paymasters and an open source mobile smart contract wallet.\n\n## Voltaire 4337 Bundler\n\nVoltaire is a modular, developer-friendly and lighting-fast Python Bundler for Ethereum EIP-4337 Account Abstraction. Voltaire is designed to operate within the peer-to-peer mempool of UserOperations, facilitating the inclusion of transactions on-chain more quickly and efficiently.\n\nVoltaire presently has complete coverage of the compatibility test suites written by ERC-4337 team. These test suites ensure that different bundlers can communicate effectively and defend against DDoS attack vectors.\n\nVoltaire is open-source, meaning that anyone can launch Voltaire and start bundling user operations for a service fee. By enabling anyone to participate in the network, the mempool becomes more robust when facing censorship attacks.\n\nA big of part of our inspiration for Voltaire is Trinity, a previous open-source Ethereum client implementation written in Python. We would like to thank the Trinity team, as well as all Python community members for their open-source contributors.\n\n## Candide Wallet\n\nOpen source smart contract mobile wallet - Available on both IOS and Android. Featuring:\n\n- On-Chain Recovery - Forget Seedphrases. Recovering a wallet though designated Recovery Contacts\n\n- Decentralized Focused - Designed to be censorship resistant and free from third party control with ERC-4337\n\n- Dapp with a Single Tap - Leveraging the power of Account Abstraction, bringing bundled calls in standardized way\n\n- Pay Network Fees with Stablecoins - Pay gas fees with supported ERC-20s\n\nFor a bit of background, EIP 4337 is the account abstraction standard for Ethereum & EVM equivalent chains that doesn't compromise on decentralisation and censorship resistance. In practical terms, this means smart contract wallets that don't depend on centralised relayers controlled by a single entity. The role of centralised relayers is replaced with a p2p network of new entities called Bundlers. As the p2p network is still in development, bundlers currently operate as standalone endpoints until they are able to participate in the unified mempool.\n\n## The problem it solves\n\nOur goal is to transition ethereum externally owned accounts (EOAs) to smart contract accounts by contributing to a higher level open infrastructure that doesn't require consensus changes to the protocol.\n\n## Funding plans\n\n- Support Voltaire ERC-4337 to operate in the p2p mempool (libp2p integration)\n- Release a safe open source verifying paymaster implementation in python\n- Release Candide Wallet in a public beta on android",
