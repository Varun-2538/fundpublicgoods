It provides the only opensource framework for decoding EVM chain transactions to human readable format across multiple EVM chains. rotki can decode any evm chain transaction to a set of standardized events, each with their own human readable description. Multiple projects out there are using it.\n2. It's the only local-first opensource app that does tracking/management and accounting in the ecosystem. Literally the only option out there if you want to do accounting for your activity in a way that is transparent, auditable and allows you to truly own your data and protect your privacy by being local-first.\n3. Deals with ethereum data querying and indexing in a local-first way. Our code is AGPL opensource and anyone can use/copy it. Through our research on data querying we have worked with many projects to improve the ways data is served by their APIs/clients/libraries to be better accessible by everyone."
