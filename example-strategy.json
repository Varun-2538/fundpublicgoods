By providing an intelligent assistant that works as your on-chain intern which is capable of querying and also executing trades.\n\nThink of Porfo as your on-chain intern who is managing your portfolio 24x7 and also giving you insights on what is going in the market, just like an intern is supposed to give.\nWe are doing this by creating a data layer in between for our users to query from and even execute there intents on-chain and off-chain.\n\nPrompts like \"When dollar index falls below 100 buy $1000 of Bitcoin\" or \"When Elon Musk tweets anything related to $DOGE buy $DOGE\" and many more would be possible for a retail trader without knowing how to code. Intents are basically the end results without the need to define the path. We believe this will be a game changer in the automations and would be an endgame for all telegram bots and ordering protocols.\nPorfo has a LLM based cross-chain solver meaning your intents can go cross-chain and off-chain too, which makes it easier to manage and secure your assets in case of a huge dip or when you want to manage a your assets across multiple chains.\nWith Porfo one will be able to setup intent templates or even share intent templates which open the huge possibility of copy trading, DeFi strategies, or intelligently managing your portfolio like DCA, or SIPs.\n\n",
